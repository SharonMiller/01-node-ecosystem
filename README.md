## README Documentation
lib contains two module files. The first exports a function that when invoked will greet with hello "arg". It takes in one argument and that is what is concatinated to hello for the greeting. If a non string is entered it will return null. The second file is called arithmetic. It has two funcitons, the first adds two arguments and returns the sum and the second subtracts two arguments and returns the difference. When an argument is passed that is not a number, the functions will return null. 

### Documentation
In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your `lib` directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.

## Submission Instructions
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request

## Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughtfully name and organize any additional configuration or module files.

* **README.md** - contains your documentation
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
* **.eslintrc.json** - contains the course linter configuration
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **.travis.yml** - contains your travis testing instructions
* **package.json** - contains npm package config 
  * jest and eslint must be dependencies
  * create a `lint` script for running eslint `"lint": "eslint **/.js"`
  * create a `test` script for running tests
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **__test__/** - contains unit tests

## Testing

### Greet Module Tests
* Write a test that expects the greet module to return `null` when you supply non-string values
* Write a test the expects the greet module to return `'hello world'`
  * This should happen when invoked with `'world'` as the first argument

### Arithmetic Module Tests
* Test each method for proper use (invoked with number arguments)
* Test each method for inproper use (invoked with one or more non-number arguments)

## Feature Tasks

### Greet Module
Create a NodeJS module in the `lib` directory named `greet.js`.  This module should export a single function.
* The `greet` function should have a single parameter (arity of one) that should expect a string as it's input
* The `greet` function should return the input name, concatenated with "hello ": eg. ("hello susan")
* The `greet` function should return `null` if the input is not a string

### Arithmetic Module
Create a NodeJS module in the `lib` directory named `arithmetic.js`. This module exports an object and should have `add` and `sub` methods that implement addition and subtraction.
* The `add` method should have a 2 parameters (airty of two)
  * `if` either argument is a non-number the function should return `null`
  * `else` return the sum of the 2 numbers
* The `sub` method should have 2 parameters (airty of two)
  * `if` either argument is a non-number the function should return `null`
  * `else` return the second parameter subtracted from the first parameter
